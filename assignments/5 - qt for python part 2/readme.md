# HW #5
For this assignment, you will develop a more full-featured QT application.  Your choices are as follows:

## Option #1: Develop a UI for a previous assignment
In this option you will develop a UI for one of your previous homework assignments (web site, scripting, or data analysis project).  At minimum, your UI should have a few buttons, text boxes, and maybe a FILE-type dropdown menu.  Here are some example ideas:

1. Create a website admin page that lets you create new posts or view existing posts through your QT application
2. Create a UI for your scrpting application that lets you input your scripting paramters. For example, if you wrote a stock picking application, you might create a UI that lets you input stock symbols.
3. Create a UI for your data analysis project by allowing the user to load a CSV file and perform statistical analysis (this one might be a bit harder than the other two)

## Option #2: Develop a basic music player in QT
Included in the same folder as this readme is a starter QT for Python application that allows users to load and play sound files.  Note that in order to play MP3 files, I had to install the correct MP3 codecs onto my computer.  The [K-Lite](https://www.codecguide.com/download_k-lite_codec_pack_basic.htm) codec pack has all of what you need to play various music files on your machine.

If you go this option, you need to add volume controls as well as proper play/stop capabilities to the music player.  As a bonus, try adding a playlist feature with the ability to skip between songs!  

In building the basic prototype, I referred to the [QMediaPlayer](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/PySide2/QtMultimedia/QMediaPlayer.html?highlight=qmediaplayer#PySide2.QtMultimedia.QMediaPlayer) documentation and [QT Audio Overview](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/audiooverview.html) page.

## Buddy Assignments
Because we don't have live-class, checking in with buddies may be a little difficult.  Instead, you will be expected to post standups and communicate regularly on the [CS Club Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/V5WbbxD).  

## Grading
This assignment is worth 100 points.  Your grade will be based on the following:
* Completing the project *_OR_*
* Demonstrating regular progress as evident by a) consistent Github checkins and b) issue tracking and/or progress board updates
* Maintaining a [design diary](../design_diary_prompts.md) for this assignment (place in the root of your project repository)
* Completing a [buddy progress report](../buddy_report.md) for each of your buddies.  You will submit your buddy report confidentially through Canvas.

## Due Date
This assignment is due midnight, April 10, 2020.  You will turn in your project by checking your code into github, submitting a link to that repository on Canvas, and submitting your buddy reports. Next, create an GIF walkthrough of your program using [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) (also available as a standalone EXE in this project's [utility folder](../../utils)).  Upload this image to your repository and put a link to the image in your reflection. *Be sure to place your reflection in _the root folder_ of your repository!*
