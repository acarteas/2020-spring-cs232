# Mini QT assignment
Because I'm missing next Wednesday's class, I have decided to assign a mini QT assignment in its place.  For this assignment, you must create a basic calculator using QT for Python.  Your calculator only needs to support basic arithmetic (+, -, *, and /) between two numbers.  

This mini-assignment is worth 25 points and will be due by the end of our next lab on the 25th.
