# HW #6
This assignment serves as an introduction to the very popular Pygame framework.  For the foundation of this assignment, you will need to fork a simple [Space Invaders-type game](https://github.com/attreyabhatt/Space-Invaders-Pygame) from Github.  Accompanying this code is a pretty good [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w) that completely walks you through the code.  

For this assignment, your task is to make the starter code better!  If you don't know where to start, consider the following:

* Add sound effect variety by adding multiple missile fire / explosion sounds.
* Add "danger" music when the aliens are close to the player
* Add a "danger" background when the aliens are close
* Space the aliens out so that they don't overlap
* As the game progresses, the aliens speed up
* Add "boss" or other special types of aliens
* Have the aliens fire at the player 
* Remember player's high score with initials between plays
* ... my list could go on for a while but hopefully you get the idea

**_NOTE_**: It is expected that you will complete several improvements to the video game.  Do not expect to get an A if you implement only one improvement! Also, be sure to inform me of the improvements that you made in your reflection as some improvements are more subtle than others.  

## Buddy Assignments
Because we don't have live-class, checking in with buddies may be a little difficult.  Instead, you will be expected to post standups and communicate regularly on the [CS Club Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/V5WbbxD).  

## Grading
This assignment is worth 100 points.  Your grade will be based on the following:
* Completing the project *_OR_*
* Demonstrating regular progress as evident by a) consistent Github checkins and b) issue tracking and/or progress board updates
* Maintaining a [design diary](../design_diary_prompts.md) for this assignment (place in the root of your project repository)

## Due Date
This assignment is due midnight, April 24, 2020.  You will turn in your project by checking your code into github, submitting a link to that repository on Canvas. Next, create an GIF walkthrough of your program using [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) (also available as a standalone EXE in this project's [utility folder](../../utils)).  Upload this image to your repository and put a link to the image in your reflection. *Be sure to place your reflection in _the root folder_ of your repository!*
